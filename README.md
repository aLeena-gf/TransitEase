The system should provide users with real-time information on scheduled buses for a specific route, allow them to select preferred buses, and facilitate secure ticket bookings. The platform aims to enhance the overall user experience for commuters relying on public transportation.


##Description

The website works when the user scans QR code available at the bus stops. It shows the scheduled buses in that route and enables them to select their desired buses and book tickets .
